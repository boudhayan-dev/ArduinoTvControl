This NOTE is for the guys who will be implementing the AI-Gesture recognition part.

From what I remember and what i have researched online , I think if you carry out the following setup , you should be 
successful in transmitting the characters via bluetooth .

* Connect the bluetooth(HC_06) module to the Desktop Serial Terminal App ( analogous to the moble app that I've used).
* Keep it running in the background .
* Now Transmit the characters using your C# script in the same COM port to which the HC-06 is paired/connected.

Give this a try . It outta work !
